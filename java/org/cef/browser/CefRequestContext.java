/**
 * A request context provides request handling for a set of related browser
 * objects. A request context is specified when creating a new browser object
 * via the CefClient.createBrowser method. Browser objects with different
 * request contexts will never be hosted in the same render process. Browser
 * objects with the same request context may or may not be hosted in the same
 * render process depending on the process model. Browser objects created
 * indirectly via the JavaScript window.open function or targeted links will
 * share the same render process and the same request context as the source
 * browser. When running in single-process mode there is only a single render
 * process (the main process) and so all browsers created in single-process mode
 * will share the same request context. This will be the first request context
 * passed into the CefClient.createBrowser method and all other request
 * context objects will be ignored.
